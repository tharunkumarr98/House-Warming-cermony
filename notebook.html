                [4] Once a pair of lines appears, they should fade out or disappear, followed by the next two lines.
                JavaScript will dynamically populate and animate the content within this `div`.

                [5] This button should also appear only after the full invitation script is shown.

                    The `span` with an icon character is a basic way to include an icon. You could also use an SVG or an icon font library.
